    "## Section 15.1 Principle of Linear Impulse and Momentum\n",
    "* Using kinematics we can rewrite the equation of motion for a particle with mass $m$ as $\\sum \\vec F = m \\vec a = \\frac{d\\vec v}{dt}$ &emsp; (15-1)\n",
    "* $\\vec a$ and $\\vec v$ are measured from an inertial frame of reference\n",
    "* We can rearrange terms and integrate between $\\vec v = \\vec v_1$ at $t= t_1$ and $\\vec v = \\vec v_2$ at $t = t_2$ to obtain $\\sum \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} {\\vec F  dt} = m \\int_{\\vec v_1}^{\\vec v_2}{d\\vec v}$ or $\\sum \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{\\vec F dt} = m \\vec v_2 - m \\vec v_1$ &emsp; (15-2)\n",
    "* This equation is called the principle of linear impulse and momentum, it can be seen it is a time integration of the equation of motion, provides a direct way of obtaining the particle's final velocity $\\vec v_2$ after a specified time period when the initial velocity is known and the forces acting on the particle are constant or are functions of time\n",
    "### Linear Momentum\n",
    "* Each vector in 15-2 are in the form $\\vec L = m \\vec v$, these vectors are called the particle's linear momentum, since $m$ is positive the linear-momentum vector has the same direction as $\\vec v$ and has units of mass times velocity (kg $\\cdot$ m/s)\n",
    "### Linear Impulse\n",
    "* Integral $\\vec I = \\int \\vec F dt$ in 15-2 is called the linear impulse, this is  a vector quantity that measures the effect of a force during the time the force acts, time positive so the impulse acts in same direction as the force, has units of force times time (N $\\cdot$ s)\n",
    "* When the force is a function of time the impulse can be found by direct integration, when the force is constant in magnitude and direction the impulse is $\\vec I = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{\\vec F_c dt} = \\vec F_c(t_2 - t_1)$\n",
    "* THe magnitude of the impulse can be represented on a graph by the area under the curve of force versus time\n",
    "### Principle of Linear Impulse and Momentum\n",
    "* 15-2 can be written as $m \\vec v_1 + \\sum \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{\\vec F dt} = m \\vec v_2$ &emsp; (15-3)\n",
    "* This states the initial momentum of a particle at $t_1$ plus the sum of all the impulses applied to the particle from $t_1$ to $t_2$ is equal to the final momentum of the particle at $t_2$\n",
    "* These terms can be graphed on impulse and momentum diagrams, the momentum diagrams are outlined shapes if the particle that indicate the direction and magnitude of the particle's initial and final momenta, $m\\vec v_1$ and $m \\vec v_2$, the impulse diagram is an outlined shape of the particle showing all the impulses acting on the particle when it is located at a point along its path\n",
    "* We can write 15-3 in terms of $x,y,z$ components $m(v_x)_1 + \\sum \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{F_x dt} = m (v_x)_2$, $m(v_y)_1 + \\sum \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{F_y dt} = m (v_y)_2$ and $m(v_z)_1 + \\sum \\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{F_z dt} = m (v_z)_2$ &emsp; (15-4)"

    "## Section 15.2 Principle of Linear Impulse and Momentum for a System of Particles\n",
    "* The principle of linear impulse and momentum for a system of particles moving relative to an inertial reference frame is obtained from the equation of motion applied to all particles in the system, $\\sum \\vec F_i = \\sum m_i \\frac{d\\vec v_i}{dt}$ &emsp; (15-5)\n",
    "* The left term represents the sum of the external forces acting on the particles (does not include internal forces as they cancel out)\n",
    "* Multiply both sides of 15-5 by $dt$ and integrate between $t=t_1$, $\\vec v_i = (\\vec v_i)_1$ and $t=t_2$, $\\vec v_i = (\\vec v_i)_2$ we obtain $\\sum m_i (\\vec v_i)_1 + \\sum \\int_{t_1)^{t_2} {\\vec F_i dt} = \\sum m_i (\\vec v_i)_2$ &emsp; (15-6)\n",
    "* This equation states the initial linear momentum of the system plus the impulses of all the external forces acting on the system between $t_1$ and $t_2$ is equal to the final linear momentum of the system\n",
    "* The location of the mass center $G$ of the system is found using $m \\vec r_G = \\sum m_i \\vec r_i$ and $m = \\sum m_i$ we can take the time derivative to obtain $m \\vec v_G = \\sum m_i \\vec v_i$, this states the total linear momentum of the system is equal to the linear momentum of an aggregate particle with mass $m = \\sum m_i$ moving with the velocity of the mass center of the system\n",
    "* We can substitute this into 15-6 to obtain $m (\\vec v_G)_1 + \\sum \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} {\\vec F_i dt} = m (\\vec v_G)_2$ &emsp; (15-7)\n",
    "* The initial linear momentum of the aggregate particle plus the external impulses acting on the system between $t_1$ and $t_2$ is equal to the final linear momentum of the aggregate particle\n",
    "* This equation justifies the application of the principle of linear impulse  and momentum to a system of particles that are a rigid body\n",
    "### Procedure for Analysis\n",
    "* Principle of linear impulse and momentum is used to solve problems involving force, time, and velocity since these are involved in the equation\n",
    "#### Free-Body Diagram\n",
    "* Establish $x,y,z$ inertial frame of reference and draw the particle's free-body diagram to account for all forces that produce an impulse on the particle\n",
    "* Direction and sense of the particle's initial and final velocities should be established\n",
    "* If a vector is unknown assume it acts in the sense of its components positive inertial coordinate\n",
    "* Alternatively draw the impulse and momentum diagrams for the particle\n",
    "#### Principle of Impulse and Momentum\n",
    "* In accordance with the coordinate system, apply principle of linear impulse and momentum, $m \\vec v_1 + \\sum \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} {\\vec F d} = m \\vec v_2$, if motion occurs in $xy$ plane the two scalar component equations can be formulated by resolving the vector components of $\\vec F$ from the FBD or by using the data on the impulse and momentum diagrams\n",
    "* Note that every force acting on the particle's FBD will create an impulse, eben though some of the forces do no work\n",
    "* Forces that are functions of time need to be integrated to obtain the impulse, on a graph the impulse is equal to the area under the force-time curve"

    "## Section 15.3 Conservation of Linear Momentum for a System of Particles\n",
    "* If the sum of the external impulses acting on a system is zero then 15-6 reduces to $\\sum m_i (\\vec v_i)_1 = \\sum m_i (\\vec v_i)_2$ &emsp; (15-8)\n",

    "* We can substitute $m \\vec v_G = \\sum m_i \\vec v_i$ into 15-8 to obtain $(\\vec v_G)_1 = (\\vec v_G)_2$ &emsp; (15-9)\n",
    "* This shows the velocity $\\vec v_G$ of the mass center for the system does not change when no external impulses are added to the system\n",
    "* Conservation of linear momentum is used when particles collide or interact\n",
    "* For application study FBD of the entire system of particles should be made to indentify the forces that create external or internal impulses and determine what direction(s) linear momentum is conserved\n",
    "* If the time period over which the motion is studied is very short some external impulses can be neglected, forces causing these negligible impulses are called nonimpulsive forces\n",
    "* Forces that are very large and act for a very short period of time produce a significant change in momentum are called impulsive forces and cannot be neglected\n",
    "* Impulsive forces usually occur due to explosion or striking one body against another\n",
    "* Nonimpulsive forces can be the weight of a body, force imparted by a slightly deformed spring having a relatively small stiffness, or any force that is very small compared to the impulsive forces\n",
    "* When deciding between a force being impulsive and nonimpulsive note that it is only during $t_1$ to $t_2$\n",
    "* Consider the effect of hitting a tennis ball with a racket, during the very short time of interaction the force of the racket on the ball is impulsive since it changes the ball's momentum significantly, the ball's weight however has negligible effect on the change in momentum and is nonimpulsive, therefore it can be neglected in the impulse-momentum analysis for this time\n",
    "* If the time is increased to last the ball's flight after the racket-ball interaction then the impulse of the ball's weight is impulsive since it changes the momentum of the ball, the ball's weight is included in the impulse-momentum analysis\n",
    "### Procedure for Analysis\n",
    "* Principle of linear impulse and momentum or conservation of linear momentum is applied to a system of particles to determine final velocities of the particles just after the period of time considered, by applying this to the entire system the internal impulses acting within the system are eliminated from analysis\n",
    "#### Free-Body Diagram\n",
    "* Establish $x,y,z$ inertial frame of reference and draw FBD for each particle in the system to identify internal and external forces\n",
    "* Conservation of linear momentum applies to the system in a direction which has no external forces or the forces are considered nonimpulsive\n",
    "* Establish direction and sense of particle's initial and final velocities, if sense is unknown assume it is in the positive inertial coordinate axis\n",
    "* Alternately draw impulse and momentum diagrams for each particle in the system\n",
    "#### Momentum Equations\n",
    "* Apply principle of linear impulse and momentum or the conservation of linear momentum in the appropriate directions\n",
    "* If it is needed to determine the internal impulse $\\int F dt$ acting on only one particle in the system, then the particle needs to be isolated and the principle of linear impulse and momentum need to be applied to this particle\n",
    "* After impulse is calculated and provided time $\\Delta t$ for which the impulse acts is known, the average impulsive force $F_{avg}$ can be found from $F_{avg} = \\int{F\\frac{dt}{\\Delta t}$"

    "## Section 15.4 Impact\n",
    "* Impact occurs when two bodies collide with one another during a very short period of time, causing relatively large (impulsive) forces to be exerted between the bodies\n",
    "* Two types of impacts\n",
    "    * Central impact occurs when the direction of motion of the mass centers of the two colliding particles is along a line passing through the mass centers of the particles, the line is called line of impact and is perpendicular to the plane of contact\n",
    "    * Oblique impact occurs when the motion of one or both of the particles makes an angle with the line of impact\n",
    "### Central Impact\n",
    "Consider two particles moving in the same direction $A$ and $B$, particle $A$ is positioned behind $B$ but the velocity of $A$ is greater\n",
    "* Particles have initial momenta, and since $(v_A)_1 > (v_B)_1$ collision will occur\n",
    "* During collision the particles must be thought of as deformable or nonrigid, the particles undergo period of deformation such that they exert an equal but opposite deformation impulse $\\int \\vec P dt$ on each other\n",
    "* At only the instant of maximum deformation both particles move with the same velocity $\\vec v$ since their relative motion is zero\n",
    "* Afterward a period of restitution occurs, the particles return to their original shape or remain permanently deformed, the equal but opposite restitution impulse $\\int \\vec R dt$ pushes the particles apart  from each other, in the real world $\\int P dt > \\int R dt$\n",
    "* Just after separation the particles have final momenta where $(v_B)_2 > (v_A)_2$\n",
    "* Usually initial velocities of the particles will be known, and it is needed to calculate the final velocities, momentum for the system of particles is conserved since during collision the internal impulses of deformation and restitution cancel, therefore requiring $m_A (v_A)_1 + m_B(v_B)_1 = m_A (v_A)_2 + m_B(v_B)_2$ &emsp; (15-10)\n",
    "* To obtain a second equation needed to solve for the final velocities we must apply principle of impulse and momentum to each particle, during deformation phase of particle $A$ we have $m_a (v_A)_1 - \\int P dt = m_A v$ and for the restitution phase we have $m_A v - \\int R dt = m_A (v_A)_2$\n",
    "* Ratio of restitution impulse to deformation impulse is called the coefficient of restitution, $e = \\frac{\\int R dt}{\\int P dt} = \\frac{v - (v_A)_2}{(v_a)_1-v}$\n",
    "* We can do the same for $B$, $e = \\frac{\\int R dt}{\\int P dt} = \\frac{(v_B)_2 - v}{v - (v_B)_1}$\n",
    "* We can eliminate $v$ from these two equations the coefficient of restitution can be expressed using the particle's initial and final velocities, $e = \\frac{(v_B)_2(v_A)_2}{(v_A)_1 - (v_B)_1}$ &emsp; (15-11)\n",
    "* If $e$ is known we can use 15-10 and 15-11 to solve for the final velocities, when doing so establish a sign convention for defining the positive direction for $\\vec v_A$ and $\\vec v_B$ and use it consistently when writing both equations, usually assume positive is to the right\n",
    "### Coefficient of Restitution\n",
    "* It can be seen that 15-11 states that $e$ is equal to the ratio of the relative velocity of the particle's separation just after impact to the relative velocity of the particle's approach just before impact\n",
    "* Measuring these relative velocities experimentally it is found that $e$ varies appreciably with impact velocity as well as with the size and shape of the colliding bodies, as a result the coefficient of restitution is only reliable when used with data which closely approximate the conditions which were known to exist when measurements of it were made\n",
    "* $e$ usually has a value between zero and one\n",
    "### Elastic Impact ($e=1$)\n",
    "* When collision between two particles is perfectly elastic the deformation impulse is equal and opposite to the restitution impulse, in the real world this can never be achieved\n",
    "### Plastic Impact ($e=0$)\n",
    "* Impact is said to be inelastic or plastic when $e=0$, here there is no restitution impulse so after collision both particles couple together and move with the same velocity\n",
    "* Principle of work and energy cannot be used for the analysis of impact problems since it is not possible to know how the internal forces of deformation and restitution vary or displace during collision\n",
    "* Knowing the particle's velocities before and after collision the energy loss during collision can be calculated on the basis of the difference in the particle's kinetic energy, $\\sum U_{1-2} = \\sum T_2 - \\sum T_1$, this energy loss occurs since some of the initial kinetic energy of the particle is transformed into thermal energy as well as creating sound and localized deformation of the material when collision occurs\n",

    "* If the impact is plastic all energy is lost in collision\n",
    "### Procedure for Analysis\n",
    "* Usually the final velocities of two smooth particles are to be found just after they are subjected to direct central impact, if coefficient of restitution, mass of each particle, and each particle's initial velocity just before impact are known you can solve the problem as follows\n",
    "* Conservation of momentum applies to the system of particles $\\sum m v_1 = \\sum m v_2$\n",
    "* Coefficient of restitution relates the relative velocities of the particle along the line of impact just before and after impact\n",
    "* When applying these equations the sense of an unknown velocity can be assumed, if solution yields negative scalar the velocity acts in the opposite sense\n",
    "### Oblique Impact\n",
    "* When oblique impact occurs between two smooth particles the particles move away from each other with velocities having unknown directions and magnitudes\n",
    "* If initial velocities are known then four unknowns are present in the problem, these unknowns can be represented as $(v_A)_2, (v_B)_2, \\theta_2,\\phi_2$ or in their $x,y$ components of the final velocities\n",
    "### Procedure for Analysis\n",
    "* If the $y$ axis is established within the plane of contact and the $x$ axis along the line of impact, the impulsive forces of deformation and restitution act only in the $x$ direction\n",
    "* By resolving the velocity or momentum vectors into components along the $x$ and $y$ axes it is possible to write four independent scalar equations to determine $(v_{Ax})_2, (v_{Ay})_2, (v_{Bx})_2, (v_{By})_2$\n",
    "* Momentum of the system is conserved along line of impact so that $\\sum m (v_x)_1 = \\sum m (v_x)_2$\n",
    "* Coefficient of restitution relates the relative velocity components of the particles along the line of impact, $e = \\frac{(v_{Bx})_2-(v_{Ax})_2}{(v_{Ax})_1 - (v_{Bx})_1}$\n",
    "* If these two equations are solved simultaneously we obtain $(v_{Ax})_2$ and $(v_{Bx})_2$\n",
    "* Momentum of particle $A$ is conserved along $y$ axis since no impulse acts on $A$ in this direction, as a result $m_A (v_{Ay})_1 = m_A (v_{Ay})_2$ or $(v_{Ay})_1 = (v_{Ay})_2$\n",

    "* Thrust acts with equal magnitude but opposite direction on $m$ of the device and $m_e$\n",
    "* We can apply the principle of impulse and momentum to the control volume to obtain $mv - m_e v_e + \\sum F_{cv} dt = (m - dm_e)(v + dv) - (m_e + dm_e)v_e$ or $\\sum F_{cv} dt = - v dm_e + m dv - dm_e dv - v_e dm_e$\n",
    "* The third term on the right can be neglected since it a second-order differential, dividing by $dt$ we obtain $\\sum F_{cv} = m \\frac{dv}{dt} - (v+v_e) \\frac{dm_e}{dt}$\n",
    "* Velocity of the device as seen by an observer moving with the particles of the ejected mass is $v_{D/e} = (v+v_e)$ therefore we can simplify to $\\sum F_{cv} = m \\frac{dv}{dt} - v_{D/e} \\frac{dm_e}{dt}$ &emsp; (15-28)\n",
    "* $\\frac{dm_e}{dt}$ is the rate at which mass is being ejected\n",
    "* Consider a rocket that has weight $\\vec W$ and is moving upward against atmospheric drag force $\\vec F_D$, the control volume considered consists of the mass of the rocket and the mass of ejected gas\n",
    "* We can apply 15-28, $-F_D - W = \\frac{W}{g} \\frac{dv}{dt} - v_{D/e} \\frac{dm_e}{dt}$\n",
    "* The last term is the thrust $\\vec T$ which the engine exerts on the rocket, noting $dv/dt = a$ we can write $T - F_D - W = \\frac{W}{g}a$\n",
    "* A FBD can be drawn to see that this equation represents application of $\\sum \\vec F = m \\vec a$ for the rocket\n",
    "### A Control Volume That Gains Mass\n",
    "* Consider a scoop or shovel, it may gain mass as it moves forward\n",
    "* Consider a device that has mass $m$ and moves forward with velocity $\\vec v$, at this instant the device is collecting a particle stream of mass $m_i$, the flow velocity $\\vec v_i$ of this injected mass is constant and independent of the velocity $\\vec v$, $\\vec v > \\vec v_i$, control volume considered includes mass of the device and mass of the injected particles\n",
    "* There is an increase in mass $dm_i$ gained by the device and an increase in velocity $d\\vec v$ during $dt$, this increase is caused by the impulse created by $\\sum \\vec F_{cv}$, the resultant of all the external forces acting on the control volume in the direction of motion\n",
    "* The force summation does not include the retarding force of the injected mass acting on the device\n",
    "* We can apply the principle of impulse and momentum to the control volume to obtain $mv + m_i v_i + \\sum F_{cv} dt = (m +dm_i)(v+dv) + (m_i - dm_i) v_i$\n",
    "* We can follow the procedure as in the last case to obtain $\\sum F_{cv} = m \\frac{dv}{dt} + (v-v_i) \\frac{dm_i}{dt}$\n",
    "* Velocity of the device seen from an observer moving with the particles of the injected mass is $v_{D/i} = (v-v_i)$, we can simplify to $\\sum F_{cv} = m \\frac{dv}{dt} + v_{D/i} \\frac{dm_i}{dt}$ &emsp; (15-29)\n",
    "* $\\frac{dm_i}{dt}$ is the rate of mass injected into the device\n",
    "* The last term represents the magnitude of force $\\vec R$ which is the force the injected mass exerts on the device, noting $dv/dt = a$ we can further simplify to $\\sum F_{cv} - R = ma$, this again is an application of $\\sum \\vec F = m \\vec a$\n",
    "* As in the case of steady flow, problems which are solved using 15-28 and 15-29 should be accompanied by an identified control volume and FBD, with the diagram you can determine $\\sum F_{cv}$ and isolate the force exerted on the device by the particle stream"
