    "## Section 12.2 Rectilinear Kinematics: Continuous Motion\n",
    "* Particle has a mass but negligible size and shape\n",
    "* Kinematics of a particle is characterized by specifying at any given instant the particle's position, velocity, and acceleration\n",
    "### Position\n",
    "* Straight-line path of a particle is defined by single coordinate axis $s$, origin $O$ on the path is a fixed point and from this point,$O$, the position coordinate $s$ is used to specify the location of the particle at any given instant\n",
    "* Magnitude of $s$ is the distance from $O$ to the particle, and the sense of direction is defined by the sign of $s$\n",
    "* Position is a vector quantity since it has magnitude and direction, but in this case it is just represented by scalar,$s$, since the direction always remains along the coordinate axis\n",
    "### Displacement\n",
    "* Displacement of a particle is the change in its position, $\\Delta s = s' - s$\n",
    "* $\\Delta s$ can be positive or negative depending on the two positions\n",
    "* Displacement of a particle is a vector quantity, and should be distinguished from the distance the particle travels,\n",
    "* The distance traveled is a positive scalar and represents the total length of the path the particle travels\n",
    "### Velocity\n",
    "* When a particle moves $\\Delta s$ during time interval $\\Delta t$ the average velocity of the particle is $v_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}$\n",
    "* When we take $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$ then we can find the instantaneous velocity, $v = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0}(\\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}) \\Rightarrow v = \\frac{ds}{dt}$ &emsp; (12-1)\n",
    "* The sign that determines the sense of the velocity is the sign of $\\Delta s$, since $\\Delta t$ is always positive\n",
    "* Speed is the magnitude of the velocity\n",
    "* Average speed is a positive scalar and is defined as the total distance traveled by a particle,$s_T$, divided by the elapsed time $\\Delta t$, $(v_{sp})_{avg} = \\frac{s_T}{\\Delta t}$\n",
    "### Acceleration\n",
    "* Average acceleration of a particle during $\\Delta t$ is $a_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$, $\\Delta v$ is the difference in the velocity during $\\Delta t$\n",
    "* Instantaneous acceleration at time $t$ is a vector that is determined by taking $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$, $a = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0}(\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}) \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{dv}{dt}$ &emsp; (12-2)\n",
    "* We can substitute 12-1 into 12-2 to obtain $a = \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$\n",
    "* The average and instantaneous acceleration can be positive or negative\n",
    "* The particle is decelerating when the particle is slowing down, i.e. speed is decreasing, when this is the case $\\Delta v$ is negative and $a$ is also negative\n",
    "* Differential relation involving displacement, velocity, acceleration along a path can be obtained by eliminating $dt$ between 12-1 and 12-2, $dt = \\frac{ds}{v} = \\frac{dv}{a} \\Rightarrow a ds = v dv$ &emsp; (12-3)\n",
    "### Constant Acceleration\n",
    "* If the acceleration is constant, each kinematic equation, $a_c = \\frac{dv}{dt}$, $v = \\frac{ds}{dt}$, and $a_c ds = v dv$ can be integrated to obtain formulas which relate $a_c$, $v$, $s$ and $t$\n",
    "### Velocity as a Function of Time\n",
    "* Integrate $a_c = \\frac{dv}{dt}$ with assumption $v = v_0$ when $t=0$, $\\int_{v_0}^v dv = \\int_0^t{a_c dt} \\Rightarrow v = v_0 + a_c t$ &emsp; (12-4)\n",
    "### Position as a Function of Time\n",
    "* Integrate $v = \\frac{ds}{dt} = v_0 + a_c t$ with assumption $s = s_0$ when $t=0$, $\\int_{s_0}^s ds = \\int_0^t{(v_0 + a_c t)dt} \\Rightarrow s = s_0 + v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a_c t^2$ &emsp; (12-5)\n",
    "### Velocity as a Function of Position\n",
    "* Solve for $t$ either by using 12-4 and substituting it into 12-5 or integrate $v dv = a_c ds$ with assumption $v= v_0$ $s=s_0$, $\\int_{v_0}^v {v dv} = \\int_{s_0}^s{a_c ds} \\Rightarrow v^2 = v^2_0 + 2 a_c(s-s_0)$ &emsp; (12-6)\n",
    "* The signs of $s_0$, $v_0$, and $a_c$ are all determined from positive direction of the $s$ axis indicated by the arrow written at the left of each equation\n",
    "### Procedure for Analysis\n",
    "* Establish a position coordinate $s$ along the path and specify fixed origin $O$ and positive direction\n",
    "* Vector quantities can be represented as algebraic scalars, sense of $s$, $v$, and $a$ is defined by their algebraic sign\n",
    "* Positive sense for each of these scalars can be indicated by an arrow shown alongside each kinematic equation as it is applied\n",
    "* If a relation is known between any two of the four variables ($s,t,v,a$) then a third variable can be obtained using one of the kinematic equations since each equation relates three variables\n",
    "* When integration is performed it is necessary that the position and velocity be known at a given instant to calculate the constant of integration if an indefinite integral is used or the limits of integration if a definite integral is used\n",
    "* Equations 12-4 - 12-6 only apply when acceleration is constant and initial conditions are $s=s_0$ and $v=v_0$ when $t=0$"
