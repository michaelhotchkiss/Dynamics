    "* The mass is a positive scalar and constant, since it is constant during acceleration, the mass provides a quantitative measure of resistance of the particle to a change in its velocity, i.e. inertia\n",

    "* Consider a particle with mass $m$ and is subjected to two forces, $\\vec F_1$ and $\\vec F_2$, the resultant of these forces produce vector $m \\vec a$, its magnitude and direction can be represented graphically on the kinetic diagram, (kinetic diagram = free-body diagram), therefore $\\sum \\vec F = m \\vec a$, if $\\vec F_R = \\sum \\vec F = \\vec 0 \\Rightarrow \\vec a = 0$ so the particle has constant velocity, these are the conditions of static equilibrium, Newtons first law of motion\n",
    "### Inertial Reference Frame\n",
    "* When using the equation of motion, it is needed that the acceleration of the particle be measured with respect to a reference frame that is fixed or translates with constant velocity, this way the observer will not accelerate and the measurements of the particle's acceleration will be the same from any reference point of this type, this frame is called the Newtonian or inertial reference frame\n",
    "* When studying motions of rockets and satellites, the inertial fixed frame is considered fixed to the stares, but dynamics problems that deal with motions on or near the surface of earth are solved by considering the inertial frame fixed to earth, even though the earth rotates about its axis and revolves around the sun these accelerations are relatively small and are considered negligible for most applications\n",
    "* Consider a person strapped to a seat on rocket sled, when the sled is at rest or has constant velocity then no force is exerted on the persons back\n",
    "* When the thrust causes the sled to accelerate then the seat exerts a force $\\vec F$ on the person pushing him forward with the sled, inertia of the persons head resists the acceleration so the head moves back against the seat, face distorts backward\n",
    "* When the sled decelerates the force of the seatbelt $\\vec F'$ pulls the body to a stop, but the head leaves contact with the back of the seat, face distorts forward, this is due to the inertia, no force is pulling the body forward, but it feels like there is"

    "* Let $\\vec r_G$ be the position vector which locates the center of mass of the particles, by the definition of center of mass, $m \\vec r_G = \\sum m_i \\vec r_i$ where $m = \\sum m_i$ (total mass of the particles)\n",

    "* If forces can be solved directly from free-body diagram apply the equations of motion in their scalar component form\n",
    "* If geometry of the problem is complicated use Cartesian vector analysis for the solution\n",
    "* Friction, if a moving particle is in contact with a rough surface it may be needed to use the frictional equation which relates frictional and normal forces acting at the surface of contact by using the coefficient of kinetic friction ($F_f = \\mu _k N$), $\\vec F_f$ always acts opposite of the motion of the particle relative to the surface of contact, if the particle is on the verge of relative motion then the coefficient of static friction should be used\n",
    "* Spring, if the particle is connected to an elastic spring with negligible mass, the spring force can be related to the deformation of the spring by equation $F_s = ks$ ($k$ is the spring's stiffness and $s$ is the stretch or compression defined as the difference between deformed length $l$ abd the undeformed length $l_0$, $s= l -l_0$)\n",

    "* If the velocity or position of the particle is to be solved it is necessary to apply the necessary kinematics equations once the particle's acceleration is determined from $\\sum \\vec F = m \\vec a$\n",

    "* If acceleration is constant use $v = v_0 + a_c t$, $s = s_0 + v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a_c t^2$, and $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2 a_c(s-s_0)$ to determine the velocity or position of the particle\n",
    "* If the problem involves the dependent motion of several particles use the method in section 12.9 to relate their accelerations, in all cases make sure the positive inertial coordinate directions used for writing the kinematic equations are the same as those used for writing the equations of motion\n",

    "### Circular Orbit\n",
    "* Speed $v_c$ required to launch a satellite into a circular orbit can be obtained by using the first statement of 13-23 $(e=0)$ and since $e$ is related to $h$ and $C$ in 13-18, $C$ must be zero to satisfy this equation since $h$ cannot be zero in 13-20, therefore using 13-21 $v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_e}{r_0}} $ &emsp; (13-25)\n",
